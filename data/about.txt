1.) Import the SQL file into the ocdla database:
	sudo mysql -p theDatabase < data/ocdla.sql


2.) Then you'll need to figure out how to change the relevant WordPress settings:
  -- Login to WordPress console and change URL (if necessary)
  -- Make manual changes to WordPress configuration/settings tables
  

3.) Dump the ocdla database
  -- Dump the database and export it back to the repo using the mysqldump database utility
   -- This is so we don't have to make these changes again.
   
	sudo mysqldump -p ocdla > data/ocdla.sql


4.) Git add / commit / push
   -- Push SQL changes back to Vagrant repo
